    </p>
    Are long, heavy hoses making you sick?
    </p>
    </p>
    Are tangled wires getting you down?
    </p>
    <p>
    Try Puffy, the reliable, configurable, wireless sip and puff controller.
    </p>
    <p>

      <li>Get Untethered - NO TUBES, NO HOSES and NO WIRES! Just pair it once, and stay in control!</li>
      <li>Never worry about battery running out in the middle of the day, it has over a month of battery life from a single charge!</li>
      <li>Get efficient! Converts morse code puffs directly into key presses on a connected computer, phone or tablet</li>
